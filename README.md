# supergenpass
SuperGenPass password generator. Based on algorithm at: https://github.com/chriszarate/supergenpass-lib

Note that to keep this script light, subdomain stripping is not done since it requires an external data source like the public suffix list. The domain you enter must be (manually) stripped by you.
